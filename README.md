  click submit and wait for files


  - python, 3.10+ https://www.python.org/downloads/
  download this repository, export it to a folder and go to cmd (cd this folder) and type:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

when files are finally on your email, download them and export to some random folder. in folder json there is a file named "memories_history.json", this is the only file you need so you can cut it from this folder and paste it into folder with downloaded repository. now you can run python file via cmd by typing "python main.py". it will start downloading all the memories to folder Downloads in folder where you put all the files. if you experience any issues, make an issue on gh, i will respond as soon as possible.
